 // Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL. 
 
 Relational databases are databases that tend to store data in a tabular format. Data will be organized in tables which are in turn organized in rows and columns. SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is what is used to manage relational databases.

 //  Why do tables need a primary key? 
 
 A primary key is needed because a primary key offers a way to uniquely identify each entry or row in the database

 // What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table. 
 
 The name given to a table column that referneces the primary key on another table is a foreign key.

 // What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables. 
 
 In order to have many to many relationships between two tables, we need to have an intermediary table that links the two together.
